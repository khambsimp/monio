The fully functional Operating System.

A refreshed OS with a different approach to utilize Theory of Computing
to develop a blueprint of a Computer Architecture that is beneficial to the society of the future.

The way that Software and Computer development is done does not actually take into consideration how people have developed and grown their understanding of Computing in particular, or Information in general. A common misconception might be Engineer's tendency to avoid current conceptualizations of the Scientific realization of computing, and instead utilize one which seems more familar. Especially to the person. Luckily, Computing as a concept is not limited.

# Cloud Computing
A great resource on this end is the aptly name Warehouse Scale Computer. Computing has been framed in terms of size (volume), weight (mass), and power (energy) as quantitiative design elements for an effcient computing platform. Lo and behold these tradeoffs are not unique to vehicles themselves. On the contrary, Computing and its operations at scale are often framed in reference to time, or energy (resource) efficiency. In other words, as people build larger and larger computing platforms, we also find that large scale building renditions of these must also operate efficiently in order to justify the resources used to develop them. In other words Computing paradigms are not only important for their impact, and reframing of information, but also their efficiency. How do operations and energy reformat and codify large amounts of information and data? Is this reformatting effective to society? Universally available?

# Distributed Computing
The goal of Monoid Internet is to explore what an information minicomputer could be.
The question at hand is, is there a better way to design computers than
the method we are using right now?

The answer is probably yes. Computers are information manipulators at their
core so programming can really look however we would like it
to.

It more so depends on the outcome you're looking for.

So typically, when we are trying to understand how computers can read and compress information. intake right now we’re living in a stage of computing so that is short term in economics sense is coming to Two servers today is thinking more than likely likely to be distributed in a format. You know similar to Jason Allen and essentially you know OK goodbye to streams of data all sequence similar to Jason and these are really propagated on the network wireless or wired fiber, if you want to get really into the millisecond, so you almost get real time or better than real time data, right then if you look at the database the biscuit you’re not limited there at three either quickly

# A Computer is a Mathematical Construct

## Logic
Human Beings can reason about Computers *exactly*. Human Beings can develop written symbollic languages which represent the state of a Computer exactly. There aprticular operators which people associate with Computers (Boolean Operators) and (Turing Complete Languages). Now these logical preceptors are also computability operators, and information encoders in the language argument and framework sense.

## Discrete Mathematics
Discrete Mathematics is a logical, and quantitative basis for scalable Algorithms and Computer Science in general. Programmers require a foundational framework to reason about Computers, Data, Information, and Networks. Discrete Mathematics tends to focus on, and provide useful techniques useful for scalable constructs useful within a context of Computing.

## Algorithms
Or Algebra designated for Discrete Mathematics, abtracts different approches to define discrete functions using variables. Algebra and Algorithms are intimately related. Algorithms and Algorithmic Analysis institute a formal way to estimate the performance of a program using analytic methods.
## Data Structures
Oftentimes to define effcient algorithms a symbolic representation must be created for both the algorithm and the data it operates upon.  When Algorithmic Analysis is applied to large scale programs, the problem of how memory and data are accessed impqct the performance of a program and its scalable nature. 
## Cryptography
Cryotpgraphy includes th sprservation of information across physical space and also in the vent that data has been corrupted intentionally, this is expecially importnt in proving the validity of data within networks.
## Programming Language Theory
Programming Kanguage theory includes the develoment of natural language shirhand that is related turing machines which operate on discrete systems in a way which poepl can reason about them.
## Type Theory
Type Theiry is a Logix  Kanguage created to further abstact the consolidation of language within a programming language making comlex functctions succing in handling off nominal notions.
## Formal Languages
Formal Languages are logic alnguages more related to shordhand logic ansd discrete notions with a ntural lanfguage.
## Theory of Computation
Theoruy of Cmoutatuon is lalrge based organization for a number of theorue which discribe the construction or discrupititon of large comyutbae and realizinble systems that can be reasoned about within the same magnitede.
## Computability Theory
This concerns where and two what extent ever more complex lanuages can be written. One could imagine a case where, even though, a particular abstract argument about computing large scale data made, the impediment to actually simulate an appropriate calculation would be the framework, or basis language of the computation. That is, when given a set of computable rules, a Computer can distill an argument in abstract human terms. The language and whether the recursive process is defined within the computer makes computability a concious abstract solution to a posed data analysis.

## Complexity Theory
As Software projects grow, so do tehe number of referenced helper ibraries, and related extractions used to limit the processsing involved to provide a usable software sresense. As the nmber of dependiencies grow for sophisticated software frame works, so does the possibility that a dependent element may break or be infected by malware. Languages must be both expressive, yet also maintain their operating intent regardless of how the algorithm is framed. Enccoding functions must conversely not be described by equally complex and dependent software entities.

## Graph Theory

Graph theory is closely related to Network Theroy and the develoment of nodes with an emphasis of how they related to one another instead of what their value is individually. Graphs are useful for modeling dependent relationships between a single entity and its m=peers. For Peoerto Peer Computing, Graphs may relate the interdependent relationships between data memebers. For protocol engineering the netwwork itself may trck relationships btween entties, howeber this may be information which can be tracked only within the ner term.
