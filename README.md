The goal of Monoid Internet is to explore what an information minicomputer could be.
The question at hand is, is there a better way to design computers than
 the method we are using right now?

 The answer is probably yes. Computers are information manipulators at their
 core so programming can really look however we would like it
 to.

 It more so depends on the outcome you're looking for.
