The fully functional Operating System

A refreshed OS with a different approach to utilize Theory of Computing
to develop a Blueprint of a Computer Architecture that is beneficial to the future.

Cloud Computing
Distributed Computing

The goal of Monoid Internet is to explore what an information minicomputer could be.
The question at hand is, is there a better way to design computers than
the method we are using right now?

The answer is probably yes. Computers are information manipulators at their
core so programming can really look however we would like it
to.

It more so depends on the outcome you're looking for.

So typically, when we are trying to understand how computers can read and compress information. intake right now we’re living in a stage of computing so that is short term in economics sense is coming to Two servers today is thinking more than likely likely to be distributed in a format. You know similar to Jason Allen and essentially you know OK goodbye to streams of data all sequence similar to Jason and these are really propagated on the network wireless or wired fiber, if you want to get really into the millisecond, so you almost get real time or better than real time data, right then if you look at the database the biscuit you’re not limited there at three either quickly

# A Computer is a mathematical construct

## Logic
Human Beings can reason about Computers *exactly*. Human Beings can develop written symbollic languages which represent the state of a Computer exactly.
## Discrete Mathematics
Mathematics is a real baseline for Computer Science, and foundational to how people reason about Computers, Data, Information, and Networks. Discrete Mathematics tends to focus on techniques useful for, and utilized within Computing.
## Algorithms
Or Algebra designated for Discrete Mathematics, abtracts different approches to define discrete functions using variables.
## Data Structures
Oftentimes to define effcient algorithms a symbolic representation must be created for both the algorithm and the data it operates upon.

This is the first instantion of the monio computer, and information translator. Input is markdown, and this is graphically communicated to the observer with exposure, the direct approach.
