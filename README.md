The fully functional Operating System

A refreshed OS with a different approach to utilize Theory of Computing
to develop a Blueprint of a Computer Architecture that is beneficial to the future.

Cloud Computing
Distributed Computing

The goal of Monoid Internet is to explore what an information minicomputer could be.
The question at hand is, is there a better way to design computers than
the method we are using right now?

The answer is probably yes. Computers are information manipulators at their
core so programming can really look however we would like it
to.

It more so depends on the outcome you're looking for.

So typically, when we are trying to understand how computers can read and compress information. intake right now we’re living in a stage of computing so that is short term in economics sense is coming to Two servers today is thinking more than likely likely to be distributed in a format. You know similar to Jason Allen and essentially you know OK goodbye to streams of data all sequence similar to Jason and these are really propagated on the network wireless or wired fiber, if you want to get really into the millisecond, so you almost get real time or better than real time data, right then if you look at the database the biscuit you’re not limited there at three either quickly
