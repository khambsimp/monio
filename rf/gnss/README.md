# Radio Frequency Engineering
# Global Navigation Satellite System
This repository holds notes on gnss receivers and technology which is utilized
to develop a gnss capability within the monio system perhaps as a module or
capability.

# GNSS System Architecture
The GNSS System components usually consisst of An anetenna, an rf cable, (dma) to then a passibve hybrid coupler, then to a muxifier, and then a receiver, and then a connecttion to a cOmputer or Pseudorange downconverter for transmission over a Netwrok.
