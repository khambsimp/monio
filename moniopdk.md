# Gist for monioPDK
# What is a PDK?
A Process Development Kit is Framework, or a discrete function, or a function of coding theory which takes a Hardware Description Language
and outputs discrete information which can be used to develop a manufacturing process for a Application Specifc Integrated Chip.
Input: Hardware Description Language
Output: GDSII file used by a Pure Play Foundry to develop an Application Specific Integrated Chip.

Note all recorded Languages are represented as a Finite Language.
This is similar to a core argument within Numerical Analysis.

Note all finite language grammar, or alrgorithmic mechanizations mechanizations
can be represented within Discrete Mathematics.

These can all be explicitly (bijection) encoded as Discrete Mathematics.



What is a Hardware Description Language how does it work?
A Hardware Description Language is usually capable of an encoding technique called High-level Synthesis.
Here the Hardware Description Lanaguage is the abstract behavioral specification of discrete system.

Transaction Level Model to Register Transfer Level design.
This is the argument that an HDL is able to encompass. However, how does an Instruction Set Architecture transfer to an HDL?

Another Process goes from Register Transfer Level to a Gate Level representation
by a logic synthesis tool.

At the Lower end a Pure Play Foundry takes a PDK file, and inputs
the mechanism to develop an ASIC as an input into their manufacturing process.
At the quality end, the completed ASIC performance can again be checked by
the PDK input files to see if when running a program it matches the implied
behavior of the HDL.

Notice a MAnufacturing process, is a Compiler of sorts.

With the power of an, honestly all of an Processor design should fall into
git quite easily. And I mean the standard one.
