# Industrial Design
Industrial Deisgn will own the integration of the various Computer form factors to achieve maximum impact for the processing architctureds developed. We are looking for a design Identiity which is looking forward towards the future, still it is able to heed history as a tremor. The industrial design should seek to optimize btween approaches thermal, to build, modification, recyclablity, and ability to fit the embedded nature of theis particular computing tradition.

# Computer Engineering
Our computers are deveoted to take a fundamental repoach to the built environment. We are looking for Computer Engineers which are looking to tightly integrate Hardware and Softwarew which developing highly
integrated embedded systems. We love when you come with an entire toolset. Utilize the latest from systems engineering, Hardware design Languages, Theorem Solvers, and Electronic Design Audtomation, to
develop Embedded Systems which will be copied for the next few decades. Explore the limit in quantifyiing processing limitations of existing sensirs, and embedded newwork instances.

# Systems Engineers
Engineers developing outside of the traditional Computer industry
still apply! Looking for Model Based, Integration, and testing organization reporting to the CTO. Systems Engineering owns the integration Mechanical, Electrical, Computer Engineering, and Software Engineering.

# Software Engineers
The Software engineering Team is our most immediate programming outfit. Software eNegineerign pushes the boundarioes of existing libraries to utilize existing ways of managing comx tasking in  ane neergy efficient form.

# Electrical Engineering
Our Electrical Engineers push the limit on the development of a efficiant and embedded low power form factor capable of a Computer which can be utilized in many use cases. Our Electrical Team can
develop man protytypes, utilizing less respources to stress the low-power nature of our architecture.

#   Mechanical Engineering
Mechanical Design will work with Test, Electrical, Thermal, and Systems, and Materials Engineering to develop an enclosure system which can tightly integrate alla of monions components and infactces in a tight package which can be mnaufactured and reliably deployed.

# Product Design
Product Design at monio is related to industrial desing, pdoduct design aldo invowes the graphics assiciated, the industrial designs and drawings for the actual product, and the vitting of it int the real world as a very efffecctive computer indeed for the various instances it is slated to be used for.
