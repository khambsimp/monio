# Here and Now

The information game.

I hope you enjoy it.

The Computer has caused so much
aura and curiosity since it's inception. But does it really
provide us a series of mechanical dials which we use to represent information?

We would assume that numbers should work better.

The idea was to look for the fundamentals that could enact a framework for communication, giving other research groups the ability to participate in shared research problems.

We know that there are some problems that current computers if designed more efficiently could provide answers for.
We build computers designed to be efficient (and experimental).

Much of what we constitute as computing came about from conversations between mathematicians around the time digital computers were being developed. The debate began over a question of language. How to represent a calculation that was ongoing. Namely, how was information interpreted by a machine, and how to store information.
Could you predict how long the calculation would take to finish would it ever stop?

one of the toughest aspects of using memory efficiently is encoding information from sensors. We look for ways to do this is in a time, and power effecient manner and with environmentally robust sensors.

There was a way to read 0s and 1s they were related to the fundamentals behind defining a countinuous function within a sequence of discrete symbols which is really a question of memeory bandwidth
This fundamental problem of apporoximating a stochastic field as a summation of continuous functions, however, can be filtered in the frequency and the complex domain, this provdies a a discrete representation of the signal in the complex domain this is dependent onf the memeory discrete bandwidth of the system,

1s and 0s were the final output sequences at the end, right before that
the probability of getting a good reading on the sensor was locked in a snapshot of the duly needed information. This sends an encoded signal to the Computer.

A turing machine encodes its eventual state as a number, a unique binary ID.
