# monio Here and Now

The information game.

I hope you enjoy it.

The Computer has caused so much infatuation,
aura, and curiosity since it's inception. But does that
inception provide us a series of dials whcih we could
utilize to fine tune mechanical change, and with it
our relationship to the invented environment.

Numbers should work better, they could more often work in our favor,
we saw it was possible to pose a crucial question to existing
industry there were still fundamentals at play.

The idea was look for the fundamentals, these enact something like a
framework, that we can communicate, giving other research groups the
ability to research some of the problems we were aware of.

As some of the mathematicians were aware of there were a number of potent conversations occuring between developers of computers. The debate bgan with not the tape and machine but the numbers which were placed there this was the fragrancy of reality spittling the probility field with a probability and that careening and propagating symmetrically thoguh time space.

There was a way to read 0s and 1s they were related to the fundamentals behind defining a countinuous function within a sequence of discrete symbols which is really a question of memeory bandwidth
This fundamental problem of apporoximating a stochastic field as a summation of continuous functions, however, can be filtered in the frequency and the complex domain, this provdies a a discrete representation of the signal in the complex domain this is dependent onf the memeory discrete bandwidth of the system,

S ssystem which is expressibel in the binary domain is also reqpresentable as an integer, these can be precessed and analyzed as algorithms and be treated with approaches examining their complexity growth,
