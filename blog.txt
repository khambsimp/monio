The purpose of this GitHub module is to learn how to utilize GitHub. GitHub is
an always on computer, and programming environment for developing software.
GitHub is capable of taking a local repository, and making it available for
download or search, anywhere the internet can literally reach them. To the full
extent of human signaling. They have GitHub Desktop, and staying at Atom text
editor. So you can have your C editor working, and a C++ working in a text
editor and upload it to the internet or Github for views and exposure.

Also the code can automatically be uploaded to a google server or amazon api
servicer and automatically web pages can be created, and uploaded on the web.

All from an atom text editor.
