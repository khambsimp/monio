The purpose of this GitHub module is to learn how to utilize GitHub. GitHub is
an always on computer, and programming environment for developing software.
GitHub is capable of taking a local repository, and making it available for
download or search, anywhere the internet can literally reach them. To the full
extent of human signaling. They have GitHub Desktop, and staying at Atom text
editor. So you can have your C editor working, and a C++ working in a text
editor and upload it to the internet or Github for views and exposure.

Also the code can automatically be uploaded to a google server or amazon api
servicer and automatically web pages can be created, and uploaded on the web.

All from an atom text editor.
The git editor also certain settings to find the state of a particular operation
or stage of the git commit.
The goal of the website engineering or front end software engineering is to
be able to type within a text editor and see the blog come alive with a webfont
of the product I would like to promote.
One of the best interfaces on the Computer to use is the CLI interface.
The GUI is even better though and gives you tons of freedom on a computer.
This editor is much better.
First try to do this through git cli.
What is not Computational complexity Theory, what is Complexity Theory?
What is the front page of the website you want to view?
Software Documentation has a Quick Start a user Guide
but then also a Developers Guide. This is true throughout Information Systems
and Mathematics.
So, for Information Science you have, the language which initiates it.
This includes, Discrete Mathematics to begin. There is also the related
disciplines.
of Mathematical theories, there is Information Theory, Linguistics, topography,
Number Systems, and Mathematical Notation.
The Cloud Computing era is here and essentially are large Buildings, even
factories of data processing. So the information Sciences consist of Information
Science, Data Science, Network Science, and Computer Science. Git is a
Distributed Source Control System. Using git a person can create websites, and
write Javascript.
What this means, is that in the context of Discrete Mathematics, is
that  Computability Theory is actually attainable, being an algorithmic
description of discrete mathematical construct. Sort of like a technical
monospaced font. So, within Information Science what are the big topics which
could be consequential to human beings today?
So it is more important to think of Discrete Computers as mathematical entities
capable of traversing the Discrete universe as it were
so here atom cannot push an update to a public remote data base because the host
server is refusing requests outside of a peculiar address. Not true.
Ryan Dahl has us beat already. If you can create a quality CLI interface that
is important as well. It is pretty similar to a quality GUI interface but you
must estimate how people will dictate the choices within a menu.
All compartmentalized is no way to build things without a focus on the algorithm.
