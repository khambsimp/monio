# the binary set is B = {0,1}
b = {0,1}
# If this were an automata or turing machine it would be have
# a state which could be communicated with the two symbols expressed above.
# Units of information represented by symbols:
# A single bit (Boolean)
b_value = False
# Natural units e
n_value = math.e
# Digits
d_value = 0

# Definition Symbol
# A symbol is a singular expression. We will use an integer.
symbol1 = 0
# Definition Capacity
# For N number of Symbols is a valid sequence (word)
# We could also examine a Microcontroller communicating with another using SPI.
# Lets take a 8 bit word Microcontroller
# The istruction word is 8 Bits
# Microcontroller transmits 1 instruction word per cycle
# we have 2^N = 256 possibilities in word expressions
# with 1 word per cycle we have a capacity of 8n bits per cycle
